I am an Associate Professor at the School of Mathematics, Hangzhou Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2018, and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2013. 

Before joining Hangzhou Normal University (2018.8), I was a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore (2016.9-2017.9). After joining Hangzhou Normal University, I was also a visiting researcher at Huawei Research Institute in Hong Kong (2019.7).

My research focuses on applied harmonic analysis, specifically the mathematical theories and algorithms relevant to signal and image processing, including compressed sensing, phase retrieval, and blind deconvolution.
