I am an Associate Professor at the School of Mathematics, Hangzhou Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2018, and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2013. 

Before joining Hangzhou Normal University in August 2018, I was a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore (2016-2017) and Huawei Research Institute Hong Kong (2019).

My research focuses on applied harmonic analysis, specifically the mathematical theories and algorithms relevant to signal and image processing, including compressed sensing, phase retrieval, and blind deconvolution.
